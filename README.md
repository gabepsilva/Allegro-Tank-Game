# Allegro-Tank-Game
Game made in C++ using allegro library.


This is a simple but low level programmed game made in DEV-CPP ide, C++ and allegro library.
Our very first descent program as students

The objective of this project was to explore:
- Object-oriented programming properties (Objects, classes, encapsulation, composition, inheritance, delegation, polymorphism)
- C++ structure
- Allego lib ( sprites, double buffering, drawing, parallax)
- Game concepts ( collision, infinite loop, events )
